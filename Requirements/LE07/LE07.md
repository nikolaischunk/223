# Adjustment of Requirements

<table><tr><th width="50%">Payment Options</th><th width="50%">Product-line</th></tr><tr><td width="50%">

### Original
Sales from the company to their employees are to be made through their payroll with a 20% discount. Sales to customers must be possible using either invoice, credit card or PayPal.
### Adjusted
Whenever an employee buys an item, the payment system must be able to add his transactions with the applied discount to his payroll.
After a bidder won an auction, the payment system must give the option to the bidder to choose his preferred payment method being either invoice, credit card or PayPal for his transaction.
### Change and Reasoning
Multiple requirements mashed together in a single one.  
-> Sensibly split into multiple ones
Reformatted the sentences.

</td><td width="50%">

### Original
The platform-software is included in every product. Additionally, every product contains individual characteristics as configuration or newly developed software.
### Adjusted
The platform-software is included in every product of the e-commerce-suite auctioning product-line.
Every product of the e-commerce-suite auctioning product-line has individual configuration or product-specific developed software.
### Change and Reasoning
Multiple requirements mashed together in a single one.
-> Sensibly split into multiple ones
Specify unquantifiable words to what is logically meant by them.

</td></tr></table><table><tr><th width="50%">Security</th><th width="50%">Reusing of Assets</th></tr><tr><td width="50%">

### Original
The online-auctioning-platform must implement modern security standards.
### Adjusted
The online-auctioning-platform must be secure against the latest OWASP top ten.
### Change and Reasoning
Not specific enough (does modern mean 2015 or last month?)

</td><td width="50%">

### Original
Existing frameworks and components from the online-shop-software must preferably be reused.
### Adjusted
The payment- and the authentication system from the online-shop-software must be reused.
### Change and Reasoning
Without specification of the reusable assets, nothing will be reused properly.

</td></tr></table><table><tr><th width="50%">Payment-Processor</th><th width="50%">Quality</th></tr><tr><td width="50%">

### Original
The online-auctioning-platform allows for the flexible implementation of a payment-processor like Saferpay or Datatrans.
### Adjusted
The online-auctioning-platform implements Saferpay as a payment-processor.
### Change and Reasoning
This requirement is not specific enough to get a good picture of what should be implemented.

</td><td width="50%">

### Original
Additionally, it is very important for the management and the product manager, that the first release of the online-auctioning-platform is of high quality and timely delivered to the client. The functionality can still be rather modest upon consulting with the client.
### Adjusted
It is very important for the management and the product manager, that the first release of the online-auctioning-platform has few, but well implemented core functionality.
### Change and Reasoning
This requirement makes it unsure, if the release should be an MMP or an MVP.
It is better to specify which functionality should be implemented, because it wont otherwise be how the client wants it to be.
