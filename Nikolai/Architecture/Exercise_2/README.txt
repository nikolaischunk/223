In this exercise the goal is to create all required business objects with their own controllers.
The focus in this exercise is to understand controllers. Check the provided "Auction_Domain_Model.png" to get an understanding of the missing objects.
The project provided in this task already has three objects built as an example: Role, authority and user.
Use these objects as a template on how to construct the missing objects.

It is to be noted that in our enviroment we return the object in setters.

As a reminder, CRUD stands for: Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete

Short description of the exercise:
1. Analyse the provided model
2. Create the missing objects
3. Create the controller with basic CRUD logic for each entity
4. Test the controllers using Postman
